# Userland-Core

This repository contains the core execution environment for userland, an off-chain execution environment that allows a smart-contract to execute without incurring the cost overheads of EVM execution. For more information on how userland achieves this, see [here](docs/concept.md).

This project is still in the development stage and is not ready for usage for production use.
